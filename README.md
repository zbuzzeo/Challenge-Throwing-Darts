# Throwing Darts
You've just recently been hired to calculate scores for a Dart Board game

## Scoring Specs
- 0 points: radius above 10
- 5 points: radius between 5 and 10 inclusive
- 10 points: radius less than 5

## Some specifications to follow
- An empty collection should return -1.
- If all radiuses are less than 5, award 100 BONUS POINTS!
- A collection of scores can be of **any length**.
- scores can be of any number between 1 and 20.

Write a function that accepts a collection of number values and returns a total score using the above specification.

## Examples:

    scoreThrows( [1, 5, 11] ) => returns 15
    scoreThrows( [15, 20, 30] ) => returns 0
    scoreThrows( [1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 2] ) => returns 60

## Additional Requirements
- Create a Git Repository for this challenge
  - commit often and have your commit messages be descriptive
- Write tests for your function using the Mocha and Chai Libraries.
  - Provide test for all cases. Handle unexpected inputs, invalid arguments, etc.
